# Accessibility (a11y) Guidelines – WCAG 2.2 AA

## Landmarks & Semantic Structure
- Use semantic HTML: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`.
- Every page must have exactly one `<main>` landmark.
- Add a **skip navigation link** as the first focusable element on every page.
- Use heading hierarchy (`h1` → `h2` → `h3`) without skipping levels.

## Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements must be reachable and operable by keyboard alone.
- Visible `:focus` indicator is required – never remove `outline` without providing an alternative.
- Manage focus explicitly after modal open/close, route changes, and dynamic content loads.

## ARIA Usage
- Prefer native HTML semantics over ARIA roles.
- When ARIA is needed: `role`, `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`.
- Dynamic regions that update asynchronously should use `aria-live="polite"`.

## Color & Contrast
- Text contrast ratio ≥ **4.5:1** (normal text), ≥ **3:1** (large text / UI components).
- Never rely on color alone to convey information – pair with text, icon, or pattern.
- Support `prefers-color-scheme` and `forced-colors` media queries.

## Forms
- Every `<input>` must have an associated `<label>` (via `for`/`id` binding or `aria-label`).
- Error messages must be programmatically associated with the input (`aria-describedby`).
- Group related fields with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`.

## Images & Media
- Informative images: descriptive `alt` text.
- Decorative images: empty `alt=""` (suppresses screen reader announcement).
- Icons rendered as SVG: use `aria-label` or `aria-hidden="true"` appropriately.

## Responsive / Reflow
- Content must reflow at 320 CSS pixels width without horizontal scrolling (WCAG 1.4.10).

## MudBlazor Specifics
- Use `AriaLabel` parameters on icon-only `<MudIconButton>`.
- Pass `aria-label` via `UserAttributes` on `<MudTextField>` when label is visually hidden.
- Test with keyboard tabbing through MudDialog and MudDrawer components.

## Verification Checklist
Before completing any UI feature:
- [ ] Keyboard navigable end-to-end
- [ ] Screen reader announces all changes (use NVDA/VoiceOver for smoke test)
- [ ] Color contrast passes (use browser DevTools or axe extension)
- [ ] All images have appropriate alt text
- [ ] Forms have labels and error associations
